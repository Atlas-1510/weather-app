# WeatherApp

This is a simple weather application, built as part of The Odin Project. The application allows a user to view weather and local time for their current location, or a custom location. Units can be changed from metric to imperial. The project use the Nominatim API for latitude/longitude lookup, and OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data for those coordinates. The geolocation API is used to get weather at user location.
